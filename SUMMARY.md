# Quick Summary: Is This Project a Realistic Experiment?

## Short Answer: **YES**

This is a legitimate 2011 research project that explored Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a brain-inspired approach to AI developed by Numenta.

## Key Facts

### Timeline
- **Created**: 2011 (8 years before GPT-2, 11 years before ChatGPT)
- **HTM Theory**: Published by Numenta (Jeff Hawkins) in 2004-2011
- **Last Update**: 2019

### What It Is
- Implementation of Numenta's Hierarchical Temporal Memory algorithm
- Brain-inspired computing based on neocortex structure
- ~1,000 lines of C code with OpenGL visualization
- Explores temporal sequence learning and prediction

### Why It's Realistic

1. **Proper provenance**: Licensed under Numenta Non-Commercial License
2. **Right era**: HTM was actively researched in 2011 alongside early deep learning
3. **Technical sophistication**: Shows deep understanding of:
   - Sparse distributed representations
   - Synaptic permanence and learning
   - Temporal sequence prediction
   - Cortical column organization

4. **Novel contributions**: Author added interesting variations:
   - Non-binary input via sensitivity thresholds
   - Afterimage decay effects
   - "Imagining" state for train-of-thought predictions

5. **Historical context**: In 2011, multiple AI approaches competed:
   - Traditional ML (SVMs, Random Forests)
   - Early deep learning (AlexNet came in 2012)
   - Brain-inspired computing (HTM, spiking neural networks)
   - Expert systems

### Why HTM Didn't Win

HTM was a legitimate research direction but deep learning ultimately scaled better:
- Better hardware alignment (GPUs + matrix operations)
- Simpler engineering (backpropagation)
- Better tooling ecosystem (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Easier to scale to large datasets

### Verdict

This is **genuine exploratory research** from an era when AI's path forward was less clear. It represents a "road not taken" that was scientifically valid for its time. The fact that it preceded LLMs makes it **more** historically interesting, not less credible.
